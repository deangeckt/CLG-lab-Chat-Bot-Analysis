I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's a simple code snippet in Python that adds two numbers together:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    sum = a + b\n    return sum\n\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\nresult = add_numbers(num1, num2)\nprint(\"The sum of the two numbers is:\", result)\n```\n\nIn this code, the `add_numbers` function takes two parameters `a` and `b` representing the two numbers to be added. It calculates their sum and returns it. Then, we prompt the user to enter two numbers, convert them to floats, and store them in `num1` and `num2`. Finally, we call the `add_numbers` function with the inputted numbers as arguments, store the result in `result`, and print it out.\n\nI hope this helps!

The code then starts with the `_start` label.\n\nThe code moves the value of `num1` into the `ax` register using the `mov` instruction. It then adds the value of `num2` to the `ax` register using the `add` instruction. The result is stored back in `sum` using the `mov` instruction.\n\nNext, the code uses the `mov` instruction to set up the parameters for the `write` system call. The `ax` register is set to 4 for the write system call, `bx` is set to 1 for the file descriptor (stdout), `cx` is set to the address of the `sum` variable, and `dx` is set to the number of bytes to write (2 bytes for a word).\n\nFinally, the code makes the `write` system call to print the sum. It then sets up the parameters for the `exit` system call using the `mov` instruction and makes the `exit` system call to terminate the program.\n\nPlease note that assembly language is platform and compiler-specific, so the syntax and system call numbers may vary depending on your specific environment.\n\nI hope this helps!
