The code then starts with the `_start` label.\n\nThe code moves the value of `num1` into the `ax` register using the `mov` instruction. It then adds the value of `num2` to the `ax` register using the `add` instruction. The result is stored back in `sum` using the `mov` instruction.\n\nNext, the code uses the `mov` instruction to set up the parameters for the `write` system call. The `ax` register is set to 4 for the write system call, `bx` is set to 1 for the file descriptor (stdout), `cx` is set to the address of the `sum` variable, and `dx` is set to the number of bytes to write (2 bytes for a word).\n\nFinally, the code makes the `write` system call to print the sum. It then sets up the parameters for the `exit` system call using the `mov` instruction and makes the `exit` system call to terminate the program.\n\nPlease note that assembly language is platform and compiler-specific, so the syntax and system call numbers may vary depending on your specific environment.\n\nI hope this helps!
