"I apologize if I came across as boring. However, as the navigator in this map game, my role is to follow your instructions and navigate through the map. If you would like to continue the adventure game and provide further instructions, I'd be happy to follow along. What should I do next?",eng,

"Got it, thanks! I'm now heading south-east along this island towards three rocks that lead to a new island. After crossing the rocks, I have arrived at the next island and I now see the frog across another island.

Which direction should I go from here? Do I take a left to the crocodile or continue straight ahead towards the frog?",eng,
I have already walked through the picnic,eng,

D o you see a mushroom?,eng,
"Great job! Now, let's add a little twist to the path. Circle around the red tent in an arc, and then continue walking south towards the sea. But remember, don't reach the water just yet! As you approach the shore, take a right turn (west) and walk below a red kayak. Let me know when you've passed the kayak.",eng,
